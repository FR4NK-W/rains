# rainsfic design

`rainsfic` automatically generates input to `rainspub` in the form of zonefiles
("fictions") in order to build naming hierarchies for test purposes; as well
as scripts using `rainsdig` to simulate queries against these hierarchies. This
is designed both for benchmarking and stress and performance testing of the
RAINS software, as well as to explore the performance of different
arrangements of servers at different points in the namespace and query
generation parameter space.
