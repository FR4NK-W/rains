# Design Denial of Existence

In a secure public naming system, all entries must be authenticated by the
authority of the particular namespace. It is straight forward to sign an
existing name with a private key corresponding to a delegated public key. But
how do we handle negative responses as there is a infinite amount of
non-existing names.
